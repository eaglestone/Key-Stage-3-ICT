Key Stage 3 ICT
===============

Introduction
------------
This repo is currently in very early stages and will contain lesson plans and resources that I am developing for my Key Stage 3 (ages 11 to 14) teaching load in a UK school.  

Plans will be based around 1hr of ICT in years 7, 8 and 9 per week.  I teach in a mixed comprehensive on the South Coast of England. We have about 1650 students on roll. We currently offer GCSE in Computing and iGCSE in Information Technology as options at Key Stage 4. The size of the classes range from just under 30 students in Year 7 to about 20 students in years 8 and 9. The curriculum here is intended to provide progression onto either of these courses.

My room is organised with project tables in the centre with four students to a table in years 8 and 9, and six to a table in year 7. I have 30 workstations around the outside of the room. So the plans are written for this setup. Please fork and adapt for your needs.

The Basis of the Curriculum
---------------------------
Although the Programme of Study for ICT in England and Wales has been dis-applied from September 2012, I have decided to base this curriculum on the National Strategy's Yearly Teaching Objectives for ICT.  I have done this for a number of reasons:

- they provide progression as students move through the Key Stage
- they afford a fairly broad mix of ICT and computer studies knowledge, skills and understanding. (In my view the previous National Curriculum orders did not lend themselves to a boring diet of MS Office application training: that was just how many schools chose to present it.)
- the Yearly Teaching Objectives are pitched so that, in theory, there should be some continuity with the skill being developed across other parts of the curriculum in England and Wales.

Having said the above, I have slimmed down a some of the objectives on 'Finding things out' and will place more emphasis on those that provide opportunities for developing computational thinking and programming (see note below). I will also be aiming to pitch the Year 9 work so that most students will have a chance of securely attaining level 7, this is higher than the original pitch of the teaching objectives in the Framework for Teaching ICT.

The aim will be to review and refine as I teach the units. Again, please fork the repository and adapt to your local needs.

A note on Computing
-------------------
We are excited to have a licence to spend more time on computing and computational thinking.  From a programming perspective, my intention is to provide progression in the form of Scratch and modelling in year 7, to Alice and Python (maybe Ruby but Python seems to be emerging as the favourite from colleagues I speak with) in year 8 and Java through Greenfoot in year 9. There will also be opportunities for learning mark-up languages (HTML5 with CSS, others being considered: Latex anyone?).  

My intention is that we develop an object orientated paradigm throughout, i.e. one of data encapsulation and the passing of messages amongst loosely coupled objects. I want the emphasis to be on the conceptual skills rather than a specific language. The same will hold true for development life-cycles, the precise type of which I am largely agnostic about from the perspective of teaching 11 to 14 year olds: I just want them to work through one so they can access levels 7 and 8 :-).
